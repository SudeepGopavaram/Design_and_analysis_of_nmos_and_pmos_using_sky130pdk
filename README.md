# Design_and_analysis_of_nmos_and_pmos_using_sky130pdk

In this project we will be working on Design and Analysis of NMOS and PMOS and inverter using the sky130 pdk.
We will be starting by using 1.8v standard model of NMOS and PMOS that are available in the pdk for our analysis which will help in determining the common working and their characterization by varying the different parameters involved with it.

After this we will be starting with our design and analysis of CMOS inverter thst includes schematic, measurement of various parameter like delay, noise margin, risetime, falltime etc.
All this analysis will act as a case study to study on SPICE.
After this we will be engaging with the designing of the layout of our inverter using MAGIC layout editor which will help in  exploring different layers available to the us and how we will be utilizing them followed by the LVS i.e comparing our layout with the schematic that we created.
This will utilize the models that are present under the skywater 130nm pdk and various open source tools like Xschem, NGSPICE, MAGIC, Netgen, etc.
I would try to keep the documentation as easily understandable by anyone who later tries to practise in the same way
